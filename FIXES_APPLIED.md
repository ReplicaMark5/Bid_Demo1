# FastAPI Backend Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. SQLite Disk I/O Error (database.py:61)
**Problem**: WAL mode was failing due to WSL2 file system limitations, causing "disk I/O error" when setting PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL.

**Root Cause**: 
- WSL2 file system doesn't fully support SQLite WAL mode on Windows mounted drives
- Existing database had corrupted WAL/SHM auxiliary files
- PRAGMA settings were failing due to file system limitations

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Modified `get_connection()` method to gracefully handle WAL mode failures
2. **Fallback Journal Mode**: Automatically falls back to DELETE mode when WAL fails
3. **Robust PRAGMA Settings**: Each PRAGMA command now has individual error handling
4. **Database File Recovery**: Migrated data from backup to fresh database file
5. **Safe Connection Settings**: Added comprehensive error handling for all database operations

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/backend/database.py`: Enhanced connection handling and error recovery
- `/app/backend/unified_api.py`: Updated database path and improved dependency error handling

### 2. CORS Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Frontend showing CORS errors - "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present"

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend was failing before CORS headers could be added due to database initialization errors
- CORS configuration could be more comprehensive

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Comprehensive Origin Support**: Added multiple localhost variations (3000, 3001, 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0)
2. **Enhanced CORS Headers**: Added explicit methods and exposed headers
3. **Backend Stability**: Fixed database issues so CORS middleware can function properly

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/backend/unified_api.py`: Enhanced CORS middleware configuration

## Database Migration Details

### Original Database Issues
- `supplier_data_clean.db`: Corrupted with persistent disk I/O errors
- `supplier_data_clean.db-wal` and `supplier_data_clean.db-shm`: Problematic auxiliary files

### Recovery Process
1. **Data Extraction**: Successfully read data from `supplier_data_clean_backup_20250728_180717.db`
2. **Fresh Database Creation**: Created `supplier_data_fresh.db` with clean schema
3. **Data Migration**: Migrated all data (4 suppliers, 1 depot, plus related records)
4. **Path Update**: Updated API to use the working database file

### Data Preserved
- 4 suppliers (including Astron and others)
- 1 depot (Blake Wayne Jackson)
- Supplier submissions, evaluations, BWM weights, and configuration data
- All application functionality maintained

## Testing Results

### Database Connection
- ✅ Fresh database connects successfully
- ✅ All queries work properly (suppliers, depots, etc.)
- ✅ No more disk I/O errors
- ✅ Graceful handling of PRAGMA failures

### API Functionality
- ✅ FastAPI module imports successfully
- ✅ Database dependency injection works
- ✅ Server can start without errors
- ✅ CORS configuration properly configured

## Recommendations

### For Production
1. **Monitor Database Performance**: Watch for any WSL2-related file system issues
2. **Regular Backups**: The backup system saved us - maintain regular backups
3. **Consider Native Linux**: For better SQLite performance, consider running in native Linux environment
4. **Database Health Checks**: Implement monitoring for disk I/O errors

### For Development
1. **Use Native File Systems**: Consider moving database to `/tmp` or native Linux paths in WSL2
2. **Alternative Database**: Consider PostgreSQL for better WSL2 compatibility if issues persist
3. **Health Endpoints**: Use `/api/health-simple` for monitoring without database dependency

## File Status
- **Working Database**: `supplier_data_fresh.db` (actively used)
- **Backup Database**: `supplier_data_clean_backup_20250728_180717.db` (recovery source)
- **Corrupted Database**: `supplier_data_clean.db` (replaced)
- **Archive**: Various backup files preserved for forensic analysis

The FastAPI backend should now work properly with both localhost:3000 CORS support and stable database operations.
